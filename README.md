# MSCS 634 – Lab 2: KNN and RNN Classifier Performance

## Author
** Komalben Suthar**

## Overview
This lab explores the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Radius Neighbors (RNN) classifiers on the Wine dataset from sklearn. It analyzes how different parameter values (K and radius) influence model accuracy.

## Key Insights
- KNN achieved the highest accuracy when K = X (best performing value).
- RNN performance was optimal around radius = Y.
- KNN is generally simpler and works well with consistent data density, while RNN adapts better to varying sample densities.

## Challenges
- Selecting appropriate radius values for RNN required experimentation.
- Ensuring fair comparison between models with different hyperparameters.
